    "As a new competitor in the field of movie production, Microsoft does not have a history to inform business decisions. They need analysis of current trends to help inform their first steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first instinct was to look into the Box Office Mojo data to determine the most and least successful movie studios, identify patterns, and make recommendations to help Microsoft be successful. After thorough analysis, the results were inconclusive due to many reasoning including the size of the datasets. I then decided to pivot to most and least successful producers and look for similar patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "I initially determined success of a movie by it's profit - the difference between a movie's gross box office and its production budget. After analysis, I determined that it came up with conclusions not suited to Microsoft's needs. For example, the most profitable movies tend to have very large budgets, but it doesn't seem prudent to recommend Microsoft make movies with very large budgets to start out, especially as I only found a correlation between budget and profit. Based on this I decided to focus on return on investment, a ratio of profit to budget, as a metric for box office success."
